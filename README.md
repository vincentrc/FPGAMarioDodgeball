# FPGAMarioDodgeball

This project is a Mario Dodgeball game that allows the users to control a Mario sprite and dodge green shells on the screen for as long as possible. The speed of the shells increses astime goes on. The game runs on a Xilinx ZedBoard FPGA platform, using the on-board ARM core to run the main game logic in C. The programmable logic for the system was written in VHDL and is used to drive an HDMI to VGA display controlled by an I2C interface. The frame to be drawn on the screen is altered and saved into block RAM by the C program on the ARM core based on used input from the push button interface. This frame is then loaded from RAM pixel-by-pixel and drawn to the display with timing controlled by the I2C interface. Project described in greater detail in the report document.
